Pin Yin is a Chrome extension.  It detects the largest block of Chinese text on a page, gets rid of everything else, and adds pin-yin pronunciation annotations.  It also provides a link to convert the more readable HTML to a Kindle friendly format for learning Chinese on the go.  Just e-mail it to your Kindle account.  The Kindle-compatible mode works for Kindle 3, Kindle Keyboard, Kindle Touch and Kindle Fire.
